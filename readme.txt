The Messenger Customer Chat plugin allows you to integrate your Messenger experience directly into your website. This allows your customers to interact with your business anytime with the same personalized, rich-media experience they get in Messenger.

The customer chat plugin automatically loads recent chat history between the person and your business, meaning recent interactions with your business on messenger.com, in the Messenger app, or in the customer chat plugin on your website will be visible. This helps create a single experience for your customers and enables you to continue the conversation even after they have left your webpage. No need to capture their information to follow up, just use the same conversation in Messenger.

<h4>HOW IT WORKS</h4>
Based on Facebook Messenger, this plugin runs like an instant messaging system. After setup, which is normally less than 2 mins, the blue badge of Facebook Messenger and the button Message Us on Facebook will appear on your pages. 

Your customers find it convenient to ask about your products or services. 

This plugin is sure to help your business with time and cost saving, yet obtain a prompt reply to visitors. 

And what else, from those received messages, you will be able to build a rich customer base for online marketing and remarketing later on. 

Cheers!
